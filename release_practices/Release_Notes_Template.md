## Release notes template
Here is a fairly basic template for update notes. NOTE: This is a follow-up document to ``release_practices/Release_Practices_README.md.`` Please read that document before reading this one. This template is heavily based off of [this template.](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/release-notes-template). Note that my technical expertise at the time of writing this is limited, and that this document is not the law.

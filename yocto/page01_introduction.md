# Introduction

## What is Yocto?

Yocto is an open-sourced project that helps developers create a custom Linux
based system on any hardware architecture. Architectures with official support includes:

- Intel
- ARM
- MIPS
- AMD
- PPC
- and more

## How to achieve customizability

Yocto has a modularized development model called the layer model. Layers are repositories that contains instructions for the build system. Layers can be reused, and users can use layers that have already been created by the community.
